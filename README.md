# crscraper_djangosite
Django Website for my Crunchyroll Webscraper project
This is the django website I made for my crunchroll webscraper project.

Displays a list of shows with the amount of episodes of each language that show has on crunchyroll

EX: Naruto Shippuden Japanese(500)

The site is live at crscraperproj.com

Clicking on a show will take you to a list of all the episodes of that show

Each episode lists what language they are in as well as has a link to take you directly to Crunchyroll
to watch the selected episode

I made this mainly for learning purposes to learn more about web development
